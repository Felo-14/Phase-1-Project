# Aircraft Safety Analysis


## Project Overview

This project aims at;

* Identifying potential risks of aircraft.

* Determining aircraft with lowest risk for a company.

* Giving insights on purchasing and operating commercial and private enterprises, for a company aspiring to expand into the aviation industry.


## Business Understanding

Our company seeks to expand into the aviation industry, and I am tasked to ensure a successful entry by identifying the lowest-risk aircraft options for both commercial and private operations.
 
I need to delve into and analyze the potential risks associated with aircraft ownership and operation, and provide actionable insights to guide the head of the new aviation division in making informed decisions about aircraft purchases.


## Data Understanding

The data being used is from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident database.

In the `data` folder is a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses), containing information from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters. 

**The key variable used include:**
1. Make (Aircraft)
2. Total Fatal Injuries
3. Number of Engines

## Recommendations

Here are the key recommendations for the company based on the analysis made:

* The company should consider purchasing aircrafts manufactured by Embraer because they were not involved in as many fatal injuries in accidents compared to other aircraft makes.

   Additionally, they are fuel-efficient, versatile, and well-suited for regional and short-haul operations.

* The company should also consider purchasing aircrafts manufactured by Airbus as they did not suffered fewer accidents leading to fatal injuries compared to other aircraft makes.

   Moreover, they are renowned for reliability, fuel-efficiency, and short-haul commercial flights.

* The company should consider purchasing twin-engine or quad-engine aircraft as they did not suffer as many accidents as single-engine aircraft, and they are commonly used today.

* The twin-engine aircraft is the most appropriate pick as advances in their designs have reduced the demand for quad-engine aircraft due to their better fuel efficiency.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the comprehensive analysis conducted has given our company valuable insights as we enter the aviation sector. Before our entry into the aviation field, it is crucial to consider the above recommendations in addition to other factors which can lead future imporvements.
